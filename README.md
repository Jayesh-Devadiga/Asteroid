# Asteroid Search

A simple react aplication in which we can search for asteroid details, using the id given to the asteroid. I am using the API from [NASA website](https://www.nasa.gov/). You can also search for random asteroid data.
A sample Asteroid ID: `20004333`

### Setup

To set up this application open your terminal and run the following command.
```
npm install
npm start

```
The above command will install all the necessary packages and run the appliation.
